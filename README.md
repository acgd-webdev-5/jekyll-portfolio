# Jekyll portfolio

## Overview

- Set up your portfolio website to use Jekyll—making the `_config.yml` file.
- **The `.gitignore` file was already created for you when you forked your `portfolio` repo.**
- Create a default layout that contains the header and footer of your website—and anything else common like the navigation.
- Start breaking apart your interactive wireframes to reduce code duplication as much as possible.
- Populate the website with all your portfolio pieces—it’s okay to have fake images still.
- Create HTML files for each portfolio piece—use the layout to add the header and footer.
- Figure out a way to reduce the duplication of code for each portfolio piece: includes, nested layouts, etc.

*Ideally there should be no code duplication.* But if you’re doing lots of custom case-studies (like you should be) there will definitely be some duplication.

**If you find yourself copying-and-pasting HTML code there’s a much better way to solve the problem.**
